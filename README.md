# Git Practice

## Article

For this assignment, I chose to talk about this [article](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2022/09/13/copilot-impact.aspx?m=1), which is about Github Copilot.

Github Copilot is an "AI pair programmer" launched by Github that was recently made available to the general public. This software uses artificial intelligence to provide advanced code-completion functionality and suggestions for programmers to aid in programming. I've always been interested in this technology since hearing about it earlier this year so I was intrigued to learn about Github's study on the effect that Copilot has had on programmers. The studies that Github did revealed that Copilot had not only allowed developers to program significantly faster, it also allowed users to feel more fulfilled with their jobs. Hence, it is pretty evident that Github Copilot would be beneficial for programmers. However, I also found the critiques of Copilot from programmers who feared that AI would take over their jobs to be quite interesting as well and should be something to look out for.
